# Inaccessible landing page

The course [Learn Accessibility on
web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility) includes a Codepen project
that demonstrates a range of accessibility problems and walks the reader
through how to solve them. Along with other code in the course, it is
licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Thanks to Carie Fisher, Alexandra
White, and Rachel Andrew for providing such a clear example to learn with.

We copied the original code to this repository and made some changes to
tailor the project to our students’ needs: 

- Connected the files with an (inaccessible) HTML head structure

- Converted SCSS to CSS

- Put the large SVG in its own file to avoid distracting scrolling

- Added some other accessibility issues so that students have some of
  their own troubleshooting to do beyond the fixes outlined in the web.dev
  course

For a full list of changes, run a diff against the initial commit (`git
diff 8aa67b`).

This repository preserves the original Apache 2.0 license.
